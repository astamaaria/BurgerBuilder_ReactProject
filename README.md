#BurgerBuilder I've been learning React for a while now and this folder contains the results of my studies on Maximilian Schwarzm√ºller's course: React 16 - The Complete Guide (incl. React Router 4 & Redux). Currently the project contains basic structure and some of the core functionalities and styles. I will update this repository as I progress on the course.

Briefly about the technologies: the project utilizes React, JavaScript, HTML and CSS and in future also Redux and Routing.
